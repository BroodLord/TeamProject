Animated dynamite sprite for 2d games


This folder includes all you need to adapt the dynamite to suit your game. if you want to just want to quickly insert a simple stick of dynamite  into your game use the complete spritesheet or key frames, which show a  complete sequence  from start to finish, from a lit fuse to the explosion. 

If you want precise control over how the dynamite works and or have different types  in your game use the separate animations included. These are. 



	A lit fuse which doesn't burn down but sparkles
	A fuse which burns down
	various	styles of dynamite bodies
	an explosion animation
	a plunger/detonator
	
	the plunger comes in two pieces for creating animations and also includes a spritesheet  animation just in case 	you prefer to incorparate it like that.
	If the plunger is a long distance from the dynamite you will have to draw your own black cable if you feel 
	it is necessary

	

By layering and combining these separate animations you can precisely manipulate how the dynamite behaves in your game. 
The exported png files are exported at 512 px but that's including the area needed for the explosion to expand into, meaning that the dynamite body is around 200 pixels. If you need bigger you can just re export from the included vector.
