This folder includes all you need to adapt the bomb to suit your game. if you want to just want to quickly insert a bomb into your game use the complete spritesheet or key frames, which show a  complete bomb animation from start to finish, from a lit fuse to the explosion. 

If you want precise control over how the bombs work and or have different types of bombs in your game use the separate animations included. These are. 

	A lit fuse which doesn't burn down but sparkles
	A fuse which burns down, in nine frames
	Bomb bodies- various styles
	And an Explosion 
	A plain bomb body which pulsates from red to black- animation to be looped.

By layering and combining these separate animations you can precisely manipulate how the bomb behaves in the game. 
The exported png files are exported at 512 px but that's including the area needed for the explosion to expand into, meaning that the bomb body is around 200 pixels. If you need bigger you can just re export from the included vector.
